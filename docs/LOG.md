## 2026-10-13 — DGX Spark (GB10, sm_121) bring-up through language footprint

Device: `spark-5822`, NVIDIA GB10 (sm_121, 48 SMs), driver 580.142, CUDA 13.0.88,
CMake 3.28.3, Rust 1.91. Measured D2D bandwidth 214.7 GB/s (manifest; 79% of
the 273 GB/s nominal). Measured SM clock under load 2553 MHz.

### Commits

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `71cd348` | Bring-up: CMake built for sm_75 instead of native (arch default must precede `project()`); `aegis_manifest` missing include dir. ctest 8/8. |
| `b16dd90` | Tier 2 `regblock_*` (3 configs) + kernel registry, `bench_gemm --list`. |
| `6bcddbe` | Tier 3 `mma_*` (4 configs): inline PTX `ldmatrix` / `.trans` / `mma.sync m16n8k16`, padded smem; PTX ISA 9.4 citations; compiles for sm_87 and sm_121. |
| `3bd2264` | Tier 4 `mma_pipe_*` (12 configs, STAGES 2/3/4): `cp.async.cg` ring; LDGSTS present, 0 spills at all STAGES. |
| `5155c5c` | `tools/tune.py` autotuner, `aegis::matmul()` dispatch (exact shape → nearest M → cuBLAS), `include/aegis/winners/sm_121.h`. |
| `90a8bbc` | C ABI `aegis.h`, `libaegis_capi.{a,so}` (exports only `aegis_*`), C11 test. |
| `5509991` | Rust workspace: `aegis-sys` (bindgen + safe wrapper), `aegis-perf` (init/ingest/winners/report/sweep). Python perf tools deprecated. |
| `397ff59` | Microbench: 6 probe binaries with SASS-proven timed loops; perf DB `microbench` table. |
| `ea33bd0` | CLAUDE.md: language map, cargo commands, rule 8 (microbench not datasheets), rule 9 (Rust/Python parity). |
| `6146771` | Pre-commit hook (build + ctest), `.claude/settings.json` permissions. |

ctest: 108/108 (5 shapes x 21 impls, `matmul_dispatch`, `capi_static`, `capi_shared`).

Gaps at or below 2.5% are inside run-to-run noise: those winners are not decisive.

### Rust vs Python perf tools (acceptance for `5509991`)

- Same JSONL ingested by both: reports byte-identical (each tool on each DB);
  kernels, measurements, winners identical except random run ids.
- Live full sweeps, same build (307 rows each, 0 correctness failures):
  identical rows and columns; median Rust/Python ratio 1.000 (Rust slower on
  122 rows, faster on 135). 11 of 307 cells have |median diff| > max(p90-p10)
  of the two runs: 3 at 4096³ (device variance, below), the rest small shapes
  where the difference is almost exactly 2.0 or 4.0 µs (discrete timing
  states, not a tool effect; both tools launch the identical bench_gemm).

### Microbench (run `55945fd9cbef`, all 11 SASS proofs pass)

- mma.sync m16n8k16 f32.f16.f16.f32: latency 29.0 cycles; peak 125.5 TFLOPS
  (8 warps/SM, 4–8 chains). cuBLAS 4096³ (91.6 TFLOPS) is 73% of it.
- ldmatrix.x4: peak 128 B/clk/SM at 8 warps/SM.
- Global→smem copy: cp.async 191 GB/s vs ld+st 183 GB/s (DRAM); 2203 vs 2170 GB/s (L2).
- Pointer chase: L1 plateau 14.5 ns up to 64 KiB; DRAM ~370–440 ns.
- The SASS proof caught ptxas hoisting all 8 `ld.shared` out of the
  bank-conflict loop; fixed with `ld.volatile.shared`.

### Open questions

1. **4096³ timing instability.** cuBLAS medians of 1496, 1973–2131 and
   2837 µs across runs; p90/median up to 1.3. Cause unmeasured (power,
   thermal or contention). The 4096³ winner rests on one measurement window.
2. **Pointer chase is not monotonic.** 8 MiB (133 ns) < 4 MiB (172 ns); jump
   at 16 MiB though L2 is 24 MiB; 128 MiB (373 ns) < 64 MiB (435 ns). One pass,
   no repeats. Not usable by a cost model yet.
3. **Bank-conflict baseline is 2 cycles/warp load, not 1.** 2-way stride
   looks free; higher ways read ~1.15x predicted. Loop likely issue- or
   latency-bound (hypothesis).
4. **ldmatrix drops 128 → 99 B/clk/SM from 8 to 16 warps/SM.** Unexplained.
5. Small-shape timings show discrete 2 µs steps between runs.
6. C ABI: kernel launchers still abort on a launch failure.
7. No git remote is configured, so nothing has been pushed.

### Next: Jetson bring-up

Build natively on the Orin Nano (sm_87), ctest, `aegis_manifest`, tune, emit
`include/aegis/winners/sm_87.h`, run `microbench/run_all.sh`, compare winners
with sm_121.

## 2026-10-13 (later) — zero Python, in-process tuner

Commits: `6146771` pre-commit hook + permissions, `98f4f26` first LOG entry,
`9aac036` harness extraction, `7365a7b` aegis_tune, `00445da` aegis-perf
tune/emit-header, `bb09d12` roofline, `4ea8a2a` Python deleted.

- **Harness**: the timing protocol lives in `src/bench/harness.{h,cu}`.
  bench_gemm output before vs after on 6 cases plus `--list`: byte-identical
  except median/p10/p90/tflops/gbps.
- **Tuning wall time, full shape set (14 shapes x 19 configs + cuBLAS, 280
  timed rows)**: `tools/tune.py` (one bench_gemm process per row) **204 s**;
  `aegis-perf tune` **9.1 s** total, of which `aegis_tune` itself **8.7 s**.
- **emit-header**: Rust output matches the tune.py-generated `sm_121.h` byte
  for byte from line 2 on (line 1 names generator and time).
- **Fresh aegis_tune (run `dea3667f1ba1`, seed 20261013) vs logged tune.py
  (`831e0287bf69`)**: same winner on 11/14 shapes. 256³ and 512x896x896 were
  logged ties. 16x896x896 is the one strict miss: its logged 8.9% gap was
  22.512 vs 24.512 µs.
- **Finding: short timings are quantized to 2.048 µs on GB10.** Medians in
  the aegis_tune run sit on multiples: 10.240, 12.288, 14.336, 22.528,
  24.576, 26.624, 28.672, 30.720 µs. Every shape under ~50 µs (all decode
  shapes, 256³, 512³) is ranked by timer ticks, not kernel speed. Fixing it
  needs a protocol change (e.g. time N back-to-back launches per event pair);
  not done, since the protocol is fixed unless agreed.
- Roofline (`results/roofline-sm121.svg`): ridge 585 FLOP/B (214.7 GB/s,
  125.5 TFLOPS mma.sync, both measured). Winners at 1024³–4096³ reach
  30–44% of roof; cuBLAS 47–67%.
- Python files tracked: 0. The hook refuses any `*.py` (tested).

Open: timer quantization (above); 4096³ variance; the three microbench
artifacts; no git remote.
